                        AI is revolutionizing cybersecurity by leveraging machine learning to enhance threat detection, 
                        automate incident response, and improve overall security posture. However, challenges such as 
                        algorithm bias and the rise of AI-driven cyber attacks highlight the need for continuous 
                        monitoring and ethical considerations in AI deployment.
